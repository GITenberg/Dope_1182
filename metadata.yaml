description: Think drug addition is solely a modern-day affliction? Think again. This
  century-old mystery novel is a testament to the fact that substance abuse has been
  around nearly as long as the substances themselves. As is often the case, increasing
  demand for illicit drugs has led to a spike in crime. Can this intrepid detective
  stem the tide?
